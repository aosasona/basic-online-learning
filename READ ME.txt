***INSTALLATION GUIDE FOR WEBSITE***

NOTE : This was developed with a server running PHP Version 5.4, please change your host's 
PHP version for best performance to either 5.4.3 or a little bit lower.

I have included all database connection-related syntaxes and scripts in the function.php 
files in the 'Siteadmin', 'Forgot-password' and main folder. Edit those to properly connect
with your mySQL server.

After entering your credentials (localhost, username, password), before anything else, run 
'function.php'script, if you run into a problem with database creation, delete the part
that says :

//Create a new database 
$db = "CREATE DATABASE global_it"
mysql_query($db)

This part is within the first 10 lines on each function.php script. Then, manually create a database
and replace "global_it" with the name of this new database in the query 

mysql_select_db("global_it") should now become mysql_select_db("name of new database")

REMEMBER THAT THERE ARE 3 DIFFERENT FUNCTION.PHP FILES WHICH YOU NEED TO MODIFY.

When creating a new course, any input you'll be entering into "Table Name" must :
-be unique
-be preferrably short
-not have any space as the database will reject it

Note : You can have multiple iterations for the same chapter show in the catalogue by simply
recreating the chapter with the same name.
